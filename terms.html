<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> {{ "now" | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</p>

<section style="max-width:720px;margin:0 auto;text-align:left">
    <h2 id="agreement" style="text-align:center">Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By installing or using the NeuraCue Android application (the "App"),
        you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms").
        If you do not agree, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2 id="service" style="text-align:center">What NeuraCue Does</h2>
    <p>
        The App lets you create reminders that trigger when you arrive at or leave specific locations ("geofences").
        The App may display your position on a map and send you notifications when a reminder triggers.
    </p>

    <h2 id="eligibility" style="text-align:center">Eligibility & Acceptable Use</h2>
    <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:0.5rem;">
        <p>
            You are responsible for using the App safely and in compliance with law
            (e.g., do not interact with the App while driving).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not misuse the App, interfere with its operation, attempt to access it by automated means,
            reverse-engineer, or circumvent technical protections.
        </p>
        <p>Do not use the App to harass, spam, or track others without consent.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="permissions" style="text-align:center">Permissions & Notifications</h2>
    <p>The App may request Android permissions to provide core features:</p>
    <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:0.5rem;">
        <p><strong>Location</strong> (approximate/precise;
            foreground and optionally background) to create and trigger geofences,
            and to show your position on the map.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Notifications</strong> to alert you when reminders trigger.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        You can manage or revoke permissions in Android Settings at any time.
        Some features may not work without the relevant permission.
    </p>

    <h2 id="third-party" style="text-align:center">Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App may rely on third-party services such as Google Play services,
        Google Maps, analytics, and crash reporting.
        Your use of those services is subject to their terms and policies. Links are provided in our
        <a href="/privacy.html" style="color:#38bdf8">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="privacy" style="text-align:center">Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        How we collect, use, and share information is described in our
        <a href="/privacy.html" style="color:#38bdf8">Privacy Policy</a>.
        By using the App, you also agree to the Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2 id="license" style="text-align:center">License & Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        We grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install
        and use the App on a device you own or control, solely for lawful, personal purposes.
        NeuraCue, the NeuraCue logo, and related marks are trademarks of NeuraCue Inc.
        Third-party marks are the property of their respective owners.
    </p>

    <h2 id="updates" style="text-align:center">Changes, Updates & Availability</h2>
    <p>
        We may modify the App (including adding or removing features) or these Terms at any time.
        If changes are material, we may notify you in-app or on this site.
        Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
        We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation, and the App may be unavailable during maintenance or outages.
    </p>

    <h2 id="disclaimer" style="text-align:center">Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT
        WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant that geofence
        triggers will occur in every circumstance or at exact locations, as accuracy depends on device sensors,
        connectivity, and platform services outside our control.
    </p>

    <h2 id="liability" style="text-align:center">Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEURACUE INC. AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS
        WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
        OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE)
        THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. To the extent any liability exists, our
        aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid (if any) for the App during
        the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) USD $10.
    </p>

    <h2 id="termination" style="text-align:center">Suspension & Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if required by law, platform rules,
        or if you violate these Terms.
        You may stop using and uninstall the App at any time.
    </p>

    <h2 id="law" style="text-align:center">Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules.
        Where permitted by law, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state
        and federal courts located in King County, Washington, for disputes arising out of these Terms or the App.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent.
